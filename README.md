# rpc-woo-framework
Woo, a simple, none code invasion, and annotation driving development RPC(Remote Procedure Call) framework composing of client and server endpoints such as Dubbo, is developed by Netty, a NIO network socket framework, and integrated with springboot architecture.
This framework similar with Dubbo accomplishes the most important function of remote procedure call from consumer, a springboot micro-service, to provider, another springboot micro-service, by transferring data using a protocol of json string encoded and decoded in utf-8.
